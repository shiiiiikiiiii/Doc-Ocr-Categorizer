# DocOcrCategorizeer

> The project is currently under development.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build an intelligent system that can automatically classify scanned documents using OCR and NLP techniques. 

The system is designed for university students to efficiently organize and manage documents like transcripts, party application forms, student records etc. 

It aims to automate the traditionally manual process of categorizing documents which is time-consuming and requires constant human supervision.
